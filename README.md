# SmartIntercom
Use your Android device as a Smart Intercom

This software allows you to set up a simple smart intercom with your old Android device.
Since lock screen widgets should be supported from the device, not all Android versions may be compatible.

Once the system is properly configured, the process is the following one:
 1. the person in front of your gate rings/clicks a virtual bell button
 2. the device sends a message to the house owner (i.e. a Twitter direct message)
 3. the house owner (video-)calls the intercom device (i.e. via Skype)
 4. the device automatically replies to the call and the communication is established
